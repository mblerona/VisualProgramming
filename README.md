# Visual Programming â€“ Windows Forms Exercises

This repository contains my **Visual Programming (C# Windows Forms)** exercises that I practiced while preparing for my Visual Programming exam.

##  Contents
- Multiple Windows Forms projects (`.csproj`) organized in folders.
- Each project demonstrates different concepts in Visual Programming.

##  What I Practiced
I built these projects by using standard **Windows Forms components** and coding them to behave according to the task requirements.  
Some of the main topics I covered include:

###  First Midterm Topics
- Using **buttons, textboxes, labels, listboxes, comboboxes, menus** and other core controls.
- Implementing **event-driven programming** (e.g., button clicks, text changes).
- Validations, enabling/disabling controls, and dynamic UI updates.

###  Second Midterm Topics
- **Drawing** with `Graphics`, `Pens`, and `Brushes`.
- Creating and managing **Scenes**.
- Using **Timers** to animate objects and control time-based events.
- Implementing **Progress Bars** to show task completion or animations.
- Making objects **move** and triggering actions when collisions or events occur.
- Deciding **when to start/stop** animations or tasks.
- Adding **Status Bars** to display useful information at runtime.

##  How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/vizuelno.git
